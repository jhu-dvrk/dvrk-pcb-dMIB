da Vinci Manipulator Interface Board (dMIB)
===========================================

This repository contains files for the da Vinci Manipulator Interface Board (dMIB) used with the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK). The primary function of this board is to serve as a connector interface between the VHDCI-68 and DB-9 connectors on the Quad Linear Amplifier (QLA) and the DL-156 pin connector of the da Vinci manipulator (MTM, PSM, or ECM). Note that the Setup Joint also has a DL-156 pin connector, but the da Vinci Setup joint Interface Board (dSIB) should be used instead.
